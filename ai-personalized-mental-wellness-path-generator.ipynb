Recognizing the overwhelming nature of available mental health resources, this project utilizes Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash model to create structured and tailored guidance based on individual needs and preferences. As an individual project for the Gen AI Capstone, this notebook demonstrates the application of several key Generative AI capabilities to address a significant human need.\n\n**Individual Contributor:** [Ayush Rana]\n\n**Project Goal:**\nThe primary goal of this project is to develop an AI system that can take user input regarding their mental wellness goals (e.g., reduce stress, improve sleep, manage anxiety) and preferred learning activities (e.g., meditation, breathing exercises, reading articles) and generate a customized learning path. This path is structured into modules with specific activities, estimated time commitments, and optional links to relevant resources.\n\n**Gen AI Capabilities Demonstrated:**\nThis project showcases the effective use of:\n* **Structured Output (JSON):** For creating organized and machine-readable learning paths.\n* **Few-shot Prompting:** To guide the Gemini model in generating the desired format and content.\n* **Basic Document Understanding:** Enabling the model to interpret user-provided needs and preferences.\n* **Controlled Generation:** Ensuring the generated content is relevant to the user's input.\n\nBy providing this personalized and structured approach, this project aims to empower individuals to take proactive steps towards improving their mental well-being.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Install Libraries","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install -U -q google-generativeai","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-20T10:30:03.571308Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-20T10:30:03.572458Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-20T10:30:07.792976Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-20T10:30:03.572398Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-20T10:30:07.791553Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":66},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Setup and API Key","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import google.generativeai as genai\nimport json\nfrom kaggle_secrets import UserSecretsClient\n\nGOOGLE_API_KEY = UserSecretsClient().get_secret(\"GOOGLE_API_KEY\")\ngenai.configure(api_key=GOOGLE_API_KEY)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-20T10:30:07.794503Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-20T10:30:07.794812Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-20T10:30:07.935610Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-20T10:30:07.794783Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-20T10:30:07.934199Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":67},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Initialize Model","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-flash')","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-20T10:30:07.937615Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-20T10:30:07.938006Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-20T10:30:07.943304Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-20T10:30:07.937975Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-20T10:30:07.942241Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":68},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## User Input","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"## User Input\ntry:\n    needs = input(\"What are your primary mental wellness goals?
