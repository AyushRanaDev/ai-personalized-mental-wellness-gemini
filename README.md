## Demonstrated Gen AI Capabilities

This project effectively demonstrates the following Generative AI capabilities:

* **Structured Output (JSON):** The personalized learning path is generated in a structured JSON format, making it easy to understand and potentially integrate into other applications.
* **Few-shot Prompting:** The prompt includes an example of a mental wellness learning path in JSON format, guiding the Gemini model on the desired output structure and content.
* **Document Understanding (Basic):** The prompt implicitly asks the model to understand the user's needs and preferences (expressed in natural language) and tailor the learning path accordingly.
* **Controlled Generation:** The user's input about their needs and preferred activities directly influences the generated learning path.

## Potential Impact and Future Directions

This project showcases the exciting potential of AI in making mental wellness support more accessible and personalized. Future developments could explore:

* More sophisticated personalization based on user feedback and progress.
* Integration with existing mental health platforms.
* Expansion to cover a wider range of mental health challenges.
* Incorporating multimedia content (audio/video).
